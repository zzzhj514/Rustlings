In variables4 we already learned how to make an immutable variable mutable
using a special keyword. Unfortunately this doesn't help us much in this exercise
because we want to assign a different typed value to an existing variable. Sometimes
you may also like to reuse existing variable names because you are just converting
values to different types like in this exercise.
Fortunately Rust has a powerful solution to this problem: 'Shadowing'!
You can read more about 'Shadowing' in the book's section 'Variables and Mutability':

Try to solve this exercise afterwards using this technique."""

We know about variables and mutability, but there is another important type of
variable available: constants.
Constants are always immutable and they are declared with keyword 'const' rather
than keyword 'let'.
Constants types must also always be annotated.

This is a really common error that can be fixed by removing one character.
It happens because Rust distinguishes between expressions and statements: expressions return a value based on their operand(s), and statements simply return a () type which behaves just like `void` in C/C++ language.
We want to return a value of `i32` type from the `square` function, but it is returning a `()` type...
They are not the same. There are two solutions:
1. Add a `return` ahead of `num * num;`
2. remove `;`, make it to be `num * num`"""
